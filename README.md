# poo

When I was building an RSS reader I discovered how broken RSS Feeds are and that inspired me to build my own RSS parsing library in Go. I thought about a name long and hard and came up with *poo*, which reflects the way website owners care about their feeds meeting the standard.

I will add support for iTunes Podcast Stuff, which was my main goal anyway.
